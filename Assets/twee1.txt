Woke up in the dark again. I have to stop waking up so ((late |early)) like this. 

Something's glowing... did I plug in my night light?

I don't remember plugging this in. I haven't used it since I was a kid. 

It's a little plastic cube, it used to glow bright green but ((someone has|it seems I )) covered it in black nail polish.
