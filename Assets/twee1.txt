A ((Girl|Boy)) was gathering berries from a hedge when ((her|his)) hand was stung by a Nettle. Smarting with the pain, ((she|he )) ran to tell ((her|his)) mother, and said to her between ((her|his)) sobs, "I only touched it ever so lightly, mother." 
"That's ((just|not )) why you got stung," she said; "if you had grasped it firmly, it ((wouldn't have hurt you in the least|would have hurt you even more))."

The Moon once begged ((her Mother|his Father)) to make ((her|him)) a ((gown|hat )). "How can I?" replied ((she|he )); "there's no fitting your figure. At one time you're a New Moon, and at another you're a Full Moon; and between whiles you're neither one nor the other."
