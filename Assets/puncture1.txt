I must have been about five when I saw the first hole. Old enough to make stuff up, but not old enough to lie. Not really.

Soon my parents would get upset whenever I talked about it. I didn't know why, but I figured the holes were just one of those things.

I guess most ((catholic|country )) kids learn there are subjects adults are uncomfortable to talk about. I knew the holes were special.

I saw the first hole ((in my dad's office|out in the garden )). That's to say that's where I was when I saw it. The holes are not not 'in' anything. They looked like black spots hovering in the air, holes between things.

I remember being worried and confused, but never scared.
