I must have been about five when I saw the first hole. Old enough to make stuff up, but not old enough to lie. Not really.

[[I quickly learned not to talk about it.|intro1]]

That would only get my parents upset. I didn't know why, but I figured the holes were just one of those things...

Like many ((catholic|country )) kids are sure to learn, there are subjects adults are just uncomfortable to talk about. 

I knew the holes were special.

I saw the first holes ((in my dad's office|out in the garden )). That's to say that's where I was when I saw them. The holes were not not 'in' anything. Rather they seemed like small tears, hovering in the space between things.

They moved a little when I did. If I moved closer they seemed to move away, if I turned my head they seemed to wobble, as pebbles refracted in a stream of water.

[[I reached out to touch it|touch1]]

[[I took a closer look at it|look1]]

(%Aintro2 I raised my hand out towards a couple of spots - and stopped. They faded as I moved in closer, disappearing into the books on my father's bookshelf. %)
(%Bintro2 I raised my hand out towards a couple of spots - and stopped. They faded as I moved in closer, disappearing into the dark leaves of the bushes. %)

I took a deep breath, kept my hand out, and ((turned my head|closed my eyes)). 

[[I felt a sharp tingling at the tip of my finger|touch2]]

Fighting the urge to pull my hand back I slowly (%Atouch1 turned my head%)(%Btouch1 opened my eyes%) and looked at my fingers.

I couldn't see anything, and the tingling subsided, replaced by the sudden smell of ((burning plastic|rotting apples )). Startled, I pulled my hand back. Gasping for air, and too scared to cry.

[[I backed away, keeping my eyes on the holes|endIntro]]
